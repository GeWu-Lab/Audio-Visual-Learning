# Motivation of audio-visual input
## Low-resolution images loss personality identities.
## Face and voice both reflect consistent personality identities.
## Voice can indicate facial attributes.

# Development Route
## Since the personality identity of the low-resolution image is often ambiguous and confused, Meishvili et al. [1] further introduced the audio signal that also carries facial attributes for recovering a more plausible face.
## While the face-voice correspondence in personality identity provides a solution for defending against this attack. Hence, Kong et al. [2] leverages the joint information of face and voice to reconstruct the authentic face given the fake face as well as the voice signal.
