# Motivation of audio-visual input
## Uni-modal information is vulnerable to the variants of environments.
## Both audio-visual contains personal identities information


# Development Route
## In the early studies of speaker verification and identification, researchers often utilize hand-crafted features and conducted decision fusion to combine audio expert and visual expert [1,2,3,4].
## As deep learning develops by leaps and bounds, the uni-modal features tend to be extracted by neural networks and more feature-level fusion methods emerge, like attention mechanism [5,6] and concatenation [7], besides decision fusion [7,8]. 
## After introducing visual modality, studies of diarization include two paths. One path argument diarization performance via integrating uni-modal results [9,10]. Another path extends the diarization task into ``who spoken when and from where'' that further localizes the speech-related region in visual [11,12]. 
## The natural audio-visual correlation is utilized to design the self-supervised audio-visual diarization method [13].
