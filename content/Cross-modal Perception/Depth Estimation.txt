# Motivation and Goal
## Binaural sound reflect spatial information.


# Development Route
## The echoes tell the bat the location and size of nearby objects and whether the object is moving. Therefore, it is feasible to use spatial audio to model visual spatial information, especially in low-light or no-light conditions. Inspired by such cases, Christensen et al. [1] proposed the BatVision system that predicts depth maps purely based on binaural echo information. 
## Further, Gao et al. [2] offered a new training way that learns image representation via interacting with the environment and fused monocular image features as well as binaural echo features, improving the depth estimation quality. 
## Beyond simply fusing audio-visual features, Parida et al. [3] explicitly took the material properties of various objects within a scene into consideration, significantly enhancing the quality of depth estimation. 
## The above methods tend to use a single audio feature, typically spectrogram, and other features are seldom been paid attention to. Hence, Irie et al. [4] introduced angular spectrum, which is useful in geometric prediction tasks, achieving impressive estimation results. Overall, audio-visual depth estimation is a developing field that promises to expand into more realistic scenarios of application.
