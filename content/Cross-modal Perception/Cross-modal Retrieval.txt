# Motivation and Goal
## Audio-visual pair contains related content.
## Searching content-related samples of other modalities.


# Development Route
## Due to the increase in audio-visual data and the increase in computation ability, audio-visual cross-modal retrieval task starts to gain attention gradually [1,2,3].
## Although multiple data have semantic consistency, their heterogeneous data forms make it necessary to map representations of different modalities to the same space, where the similarity of data pairs reflects the semantic distance. Variants of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), which finds transformations of two views via maximizing the pairwise correlation including Kernel-CCA, Deep-CCA and Cluster-CCA, are broadly utilized in the cross-modal retrieval task. 
## Besides CCA-based methods, some methods introduce other constraints to train the multi-modal model with a joint embedding space. Hong et al. [1] used the inter-modal ranking loss to improve the semantic similarity between video-music pairs. Sur{\'\i}s et al. [2] utilized both the cosine similarity loss and classification loss to project the uni-modal features into the common feature space. 
## These retrieval methods has been applied many cross-modal perception tasks, including music recommendation given video [1,4] and dance generation [5].
